## Aircraft Identification

Satellite imagery provides an invaluable source of near-real-time data on the movement and positioning of assets across the globe. The past two decades have witnessed a dramatic surge in both image resolution and the sheer number of satellite imaging systems. However, this abundance of data has also created a challenge: the volume of imagery far surpasses the capacity for manual review by specialists.

By automating the analysis of satellite imagery, we can extract critical insights, such as the quantity and location of mobile assets like aircraft, which are essential for maintaining situational awareness and information dominance.

**In this project, you will develop a model which can identify commercial and non-commercial aircraft in satellite images.**

This capstone project challenges you to develop this model using a two-phased approach:

### Commercial Aircraft Detection

The first phase focuses on building a robust model capable of accurately locating commercial aircraft within satellite images of airports. Your model will be rigorously validated using a diverse set of similar airport images, ensuring its accuracy and generalization capabilities.

### Non-Commercial Aircraft Counting

In the second phase, the focus shifts to non-commercial aircraft. You'll be provided with a limited dataset of satellite images featuring non-commercial aircraft, along with their corresponding labels. Leveraging the model developed in phase one and employing transfer learning techniques, you'll fine-tune your model to accurately count the number of non-commercial aircraft present in a collection of similar airfield images.

### The Customer

Imagine the "customer" as a national security agency tasked with monitoring airfields and assessing potential threats. You will develop a model capable of accurately detecting and counting aircraft, contributing to enhanced national security through automated aerial surveillance.
