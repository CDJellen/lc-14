## Jupyter Lab

Jupyter notebooks are web-based interactive environments that allow users to combine code, visualizations, and narrative text in a single document. This unique combination makes them ideal for data exploration, analysis, and communication. Jupyter notebooks are built on the Jupyter project, a non-profit organization dedicated to developing open-source software for interactive computing.
